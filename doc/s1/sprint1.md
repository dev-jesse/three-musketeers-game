Our goal for this sprint is to complete: the Greedy/Random Agent implementation using the strategy pattern, to complete the Interactive Board UI which uses the MVC pattern as well as the Undo functionality which uses the command pattern. 

Stories for Sprint1: An implementation of undo-ing a move inside the game, to be able to make custom positions and play the game from those custom board positions,
to be able to make custom positions and play the game from those custom board positions, I want a more user-friendly interface to play Three Musketeers where I use the mouse to be able to move my pieces to make it more intuitive, I want to be able to save the board, I want to be able to restart the board.

Team Capactity: We hope to complete most, if not all of the Strategy, MVC and Command pattern implementations for Sprint1 based on our current team.
