After each sprint, you should conduct your sprint retrospective meeting. Appoint a notetaker and
document your observations about sprint 1 in a document named SR1.md in doc/sprint1.
You should record:
● The participants in the meeting
● Any unfinished tasks
● What are practices that you should continue during the next sprint?
● What are some new practices that you might want to use during the next sprint?
● What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during the next sprint?
● What was your best/worst experience during sprint 1?

Participants: Alan, Glyn, Muzzammil, Jesse.

Unfinished tasks: MVC pattern, Builder pattern, Factory pattern.

Practices we should continue during the next sprint:
1) Git pulling before starting to work on a branch, and pushing once we are done for the day.
2) Communicate daily/every other day on status of completion.

New practices we might want to use during the next sprint:
1) Naming the commits properly and writing a good summary of the changes in the commits instead of generic.
2) Create more pull requests to check on code quality

Harmful practices we should stop using during the next sprint:
1) We did not name the commits properly by prepending the messages with [FEATURE]<message> where message describes the commit details.
2) Sometimes, we did not git pull before working on the same branches.
3) Not writing enough comments to describe code.

Experiences:
Best: Merging the 50 commits made in one branch and being super relieved afterwards.
Worst: The worst experience was trying to figure out how to navigate github branches correctly. Many of us did not have our local branch [FEATURE] tracking the remote branch [FEATURE] on github. Also merge conflicts :((
