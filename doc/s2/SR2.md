Participants: Alan, Jesse, Glyn, Muzzammil

Unfinished Tasks: We finished everything we intended to.

Good practices that helped us during the sprint: 
1) Meeting on a consistent basis and having a clear bridge of communication. 
2) Not being afraid to ask questions from each other or the TA
3) Proper naming of GIT branches and meaningful commit messages 

New Practices to Employ: 
1) Helping each other with git workflow 
2) Creating more pull requests.
3) Writing more accurate code reviews 
4) Clean up code/got rid of unnecessary functions/attributes before pushing to develop

Harmful Practices: 
1) Not cleaning up code/getting rid of unnecessary functions/attributes  
2) We treated standups as a personal update instead of using it to help update our groupmates. 

Experiences: 
Best: Merging completed features together and seeing the main program develop. 
Worst: Resolving merge conflicts. Waiting for blockers to be completed.
